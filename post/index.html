        PCA for Anomaly Detection
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Collaborators: Tim Wickard
Description:
This project was done as consulting work for a manufacturing plant which had a vast amount of process data from their plant&rsquo;s sensor network (data have been anonymized here). The goal was to build a model to detect anomalies in the data that could contribute to defects in the produced membranes. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to find anomalous data and learn which features in the sensor network contributed the most to this anomalous behavior.

        Association and other forms of positive dependence for Feller evolution systems

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      (Paper published in &ldquo;Theory of Probability and Its Applications&rdquo; in January 2021)
Abstract: We characterize various forms of positive dependence for a general class of time-inhomogeneous Markov processes called Feller evolution processes (FEPs) and for jump-FEPs. General FEPs can be studied through their time and state-space dependent (extended) generators. We will use the time and state-space dependent (extended) generators and time and state-space dependent LÃ©vy measures to characterize the positive dependence of general FEPs and jump-FEPs, respectively.

        On association and other forms of positive dependence for Feller processes

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      (Paper published in &ldquo;Journal of Applied Probability&rdquo; in June 2019)
Abstract: We characterize various forms of positive dependence, such as association, positive supermodular association and dependence, and positive orthant dependence, for jump-Feller processes. Such jump processes can be studied through their state-space dependent LÃ©vy measures. It is through these LÃ©vy measures that we will provide our characterization. Finally, we present applications of these results to stochastically monotone Feller processes, including LÃ©vy processes, the OrnsteinâUhlenbeck process, pseudo-Poisson processes, and subordinated Feller processes.

        Dependence structures in LÃ©vy-type Markov processes
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      (Dissertation awarded August 2017)
Abstract: In this dissertation, we examine the positive and negative dependence of infinitely divisible distributions and LÃ©vy-type Markov processes. Examples of infinitely divisible distributions include Poissonian distributions like compound Poisson and Î±-stable distributions. Examples of LÃ©vy-type Markov processes include LÃ©vy processes and Feller processes, which include a class of jump-diffusions, certain stochastic differential equations with LÃ©vy noise, and subordinated Markov processes. Other examples of LÃ©vy-type Markov processes are time-inhomogeneous Feller evolution systems (FES), which include additive processes.

        PCA for Anomaly Detection
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Collaborators: Tim Wickard
Description:
This project was done as consulting work for a manufacturing plant which had a vast amount of process data from their plant&rsquo;s sensor network (data have been anonymized here). The goal was to build a model to detect anomalies in the data that could contribute to defects in the produced membranes. We used Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to find anomalous data and learn which features in the sensor network contributed the most to this anomalous behavior.

        Association and other forms of positive dependence for Feller evolution systems

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      (Paper published in &ldquo;Theory of Probability and Its Applications&rdquo; in January 2021)
Abstract: We characterize various forms of positive dependence for a general class of time-inhomogeneous Markov processes called Feller evolution processes (FEPs) and for jump-FEPs. General FEPs can be studied through their time and state-space dependent (extended) generators. We will use the time and state-space dependent (extended) generators and time and state-space dependent Lévy measures to characterize the positive dependence of general FEPs and jump-FEPs, respectively.

        On association and other forms of positive dependence for Feller processes

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      (Paper published in &ldquo;Journal of Applied Probability&rdquo; in June 2019)
Abstract: We characterize various forms of positive dependence, such as association, positive supermodular association and dependence, and positive orthant dependence, for jump-Feller processes. Such jump processes can be studied through their state-space dependent Lévy measures. It is through these Lévy measures that we will provide our characterization. Finally, we present applications of these results to stochastically monotone Feller processes, including Lévy processes, the Ornstein–Uhlenbeck process, pseudo-Poisson processes, and subordinated Feller processes.

        Dependence structures in Lévy-type Markov processes
      </a>
    </h1>
    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      (Dissertation awarded August 2017)
Abstract: In this dissertation, we examine the positive and negative dependence of infinitely divisible distributions and Lévy-type Markov processes. Examples of infinitely divisible distributions include Poissonian distributions like compound Poisson and α-stable distributions. Examples of Lévy-type Markov processes include Lévy processes and Feller processes, which include a class of jump-diffusions, certain stochastic differential equations with Lévy noise, and subordinated Markov processes. Other examples of Lévy-type Markov processes are time-inhomogeneous Feller evolution systems (FES), which include additive processes.
